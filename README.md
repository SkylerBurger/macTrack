# MacTrack
A macronutrient calculator and diet tracker.

Deployed Site: [https://mactrack-v2.herokuapp.com/](https://mactrack-v2.herokuapp.com/)

*Currently has over-simplified login. Create a user by registering and then log in with your name.

## Project Scope:
The MVP of MacTrack will allow a user to generate an initial set of macronutrient targets. They will then be able to track their progress by adding foods to their day.

## Stretch Goals:
- Allow a user to tweak their macronutrient targets or change variables that will recalculate their target for them. 
- Create a page for a week view of their progress and an average for the week.
- Allow user to change entries for previous days
